                  The common interest that members of the Association share is to
                  inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair
                  play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or
                  referee whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to
                  disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey background,
                  expertise, accomplishments or standing.

                     <strong>DIMENSIONS.</strong> IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field
                      dimensions within a given maximum and minimum width and
                      length. These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields
                      used by teams under 12 and older.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                     <strong>COMPETITION FIELDS.</strong>  Fields used within the competition program
                      must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or
                      associations participating in the state competition program
                      that are unable to provide a field that meets these minimum
                      requirements must advise the State Competition Board which
                      will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and
                      recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
                      dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
                      associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field
                      may be required to play all their games away.

                            U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no
                            penalty areas. Fields for older age groups should be
                            progressively larger.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards
                            width.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards
                            in width.

                          <li>
                            In addition, fields used by young age groups may have
                            their internal dimensions and size of goal similarly
                            modified.

                    All-play means that every recreation player on every team shall
                    play atleast fifty percent of each game. Coaches in the
                    competition program are encouraged to play their players 50% of
                    each game.

                        game under special circumstances, e.g., unexcused absences
                        from practice and/or games, ungentlemanly conduct at practice
                        and/or games, and injuries.
